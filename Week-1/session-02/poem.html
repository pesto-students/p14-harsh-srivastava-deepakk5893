    <p>
			I'm Nobody! Who are you?<br>
			Are you - Nobody - Too?<br>
			Then there's a pair of us!<br>
			Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know!
    </p>
    <p>
			How dreary - to be - Somebody!<br>
			How public - like a Frog -<br>
			To tell one's name - the livelong June - To an admiring Bog!
    </p>
