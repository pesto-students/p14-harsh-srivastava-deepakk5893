1.What is a protocol stack, and how is it used in web development?
    When data travels through the internet, it passes through multiple layers of protocols, each responsible for a specific task and together we call it protocol stack. So, Protocol stack are set of rules that allows machines to communicate on the internet. these protocols are organized into layers, with each layer building on top of the one below it
    
    a. Link Layer: At the bottom layer, devices need a way to physically send and receive digital data over wired or wireless connections. This layer handles the transmission of signals as bits and deals with issues related to the physical connection.

    b. Network Layer: To communicate beyond two directly connected devices, we need addressing protocols to identify the sender and receiver of data. The IP (Internet Protocol) addresses are used for this purpose, uniquely identifying each device on the internet.

    c. Transport Layer: Data on the internet is divided into small packets for efficient transmission. The Transport Layer manages the reliable and orderly delivery of these packets. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) ensures data is delivered accurately, while UDP (User Datagram Protocol) provides faster but less reliable communication.

    d. Application Layer: At the top layer, we find various protocols that cater to specific services and applications on the internet. Some examples include:

3.What is web hosting, and what are the different types of hosting services available for websites?
    Web hosting refers to the service that allows individuals and organizations to make their websites accessible via the World Wide Web. Web hosting providers offer the necessary technologies and services to store website files, databases, and other resources, making websites accessible to users across the internet. These services are provided through specialized servers that are connected to the internet. Different types of web hosting services available include:

    Shared Hosting:
        In shared hosting, multiple websites are hosted on a single server, sharing its resources like CPU, disk space, and memory.
        It's a cost-effective option suitable for small to medium-sized websites with moderate traffic.
        Since resources are shared, the performance might be affected if one website consumes excessive resources.

    Virtual Private Server (VPS) Hosting:
        VPS hosting offers a more advanced setup compared to shared hosting. It involves partitioning a physical server into multiple virtual servers, each acting as an independent server environment.
        Each VPS has its own dedicated resources like CPU, RAM, storage, and operating system, providing better performance and control compared to shared hosting.
        It's suitable for websites needing more resources and customization options.

    Dedicated Server Hosting:
        With dedicated server hosting, a single physical server is exclusively leased to a single user or organization, offering full control over resources.
        It provides high performance, maximum security, and customization options but tends to be more expensive than shared or VPS hosting.
        Ideal for large websites with high traffic, resource-intensive applications, or specific security and compliance requirements.

    Cloud Hosting:
        Cloud hosting utilizes multiple interconnected servers in a network to distribute resources and handle website traffic dynamically.
        It offers scalability, flexibility, and reliability by allowing resources to be allocated on-demand, enabling websites to handle sudden traffic spikes without downtime.
        Users pay for the resources they use, making it cost-effective and suitable for growing websites.

    Managed WordPress Hosting:
        Specifically optimized for WordPress websites, this hosting type offers features like automatic updates, enhanced security, and specialized support for WordPress-related issues.
